# Project Intelligence

This file is the learning memory for AI agents working on this project. It captures patterns, decisions, and tribal knowledge that help future iterations work faster and smarter.

## Quick Reference

### Critical Commands
```bash
# Build
[YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND]

# Test
[YOUR_TEST_COMMAND]

# Lint
[YOUR_LINT_COMMAND]

# Type check
[YOUR_TYPECHECK_COMMAND]
```

### Project Structure
```
[DESCRIBE KEY DIRECTORIES AND THEIR PURPOSE]
```

---

## Code Patterns

### Naming Conventions
<!-- How are things named in this project? -->
- Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `PlayerHealth.ts`)
- Functions: `camelCase` (e.g., `calculateDamage()`)
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_HEALTH`)
- Files: [describe pattern]

### Import Patterns
<!-- How are imports organized? -->
```typescript
// Example import order/style used in this project
```

### Error Handling
<!-- How does this project handle errors? -->
```typescript
// Example error handling pattern
```

### State Management
<!-- How is state managed? -->
- Pattern: [Redux/Context/Zustand/etc.]
- Location: [where state lives]

### API Patterns
<!-- How are API calls structured? -->
```typescript
// Example API call pattern
```

---

## Architecture Decisions

### Why [DECISION]?
<!-- Document important architectural choices -->
- Decision: [what was decided]
- Reason: [why it was decided]
- Alternatives considered: [what else was considered]

---

## Known Gotchas

<!-- Things that will trip you up if you don't know -->

### [GOTCHA NAME]
- **Problem**: [what goes wrong]
- **Solution**: [how to avoid/fix it]
- **Files affected**: [relevant files]

---

## Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies
| Package | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| [name] | [why it's used] | [any quirks] |

### Internal Dependencies
<!-- Which modules depend on which? -->
- `[Module A]` depends on `[Module B]`

---

## Testing Patterns

### Test File Location
- Unit tests: `[path]`
- Integration tests: `[path]`
- E2E tests: `[path]`

### Test Naming Convention
```typescript
// Example test pattern
describe('[Component/Function]', () => {
  it('should [expected behavior]', () => {
    // test
  });
});
```

### Mocking Patterns
```typescript
// How to mock [common thing] in this project
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Known Bottlenecks
- [area]: [why it's slow, how to work around]

### Optimization Patterns
- [pattern]: [when to use it]

---

## Environment & Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Required
REQUIRED_VAR=value

# Optional
OPTIONAL_VAR=default_value
```

### Configuration Files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [file] | [what it configures] |

---

## Recent Learnings

<!-- Auto-populated section - most recent discoveries go here -->
<!-- Format: [DATE] - [LEARNING] -->

### [DATE]
- **Context**: [what was being worked on]
- **Discovery**: [what was learned]
- **Impact**: [how it affects future work]

### `/src/utils/`
<!-- Patterns specific to this directory -->

## DO NOT

<!-- Things to absolutely avoid -->
- [ ] Never [thing to avoid]
- [ ] Always [thing to always do instead]
